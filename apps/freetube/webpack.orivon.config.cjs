// out of this repo -- AGPL-3.0-or-later -- only this config is ours).

// Requires upstream's OWN `_scripts/webpack.web.config.js` from a clone path
// (FREETUBE_CLONE) and changes only what compiling the Electron renderer,
// rather than a browser tab, needs. See ../README.md's "Why the Electron
// renderer, not the web build" for the reasoning.

// Runs with the clone as its working directory, so `npx webpack` resolves the
// clone's own webpack-cli. This file's own `require('webpack')` is resolved
// against the clone too (below), not against this repo, which has no webpack.
